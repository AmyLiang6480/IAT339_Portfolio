                <h2>Collaboration</h2>
                <p>To collaborate effectively on this project, we used GitKraken, which allowed us to distribute the work and merge it later. We created branches for each feature, which allowed us to work on different aspects of the project simultaneously without interfering with each other's progress.</p>
                <p>We also set up a weekly check-in to discuss our progress and ensure that we were on track to meet our deadlines.</p>

                <h2>Design Process</h2>
                <p>Our team started the design process by consolidating our style guides into one single document. We ensured that the document included all the materials required and was in the form of a clear, nicely organized style guide. </p>
                <p>We built in responsive aspects from the start, ensuring that the website was accessible on all devices. We also designed consistent interfaces and interaction elements to improve user experience.</p>

                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>Looked for common issues and points of confusion throughout studies done by users. The major issue became to one of our key feature: a family page where user could save their grandchildren’s information, so when they select specific grandchild, the app can filter content for them based on their age, dietary preferences and restrictions. But this feature confused most users in our user testing: Four participants went to the home page to find the information about what a grandchild likes, a task that was supposed to be completed on the Family page. It conflicts our ultimate goal of offering a light user experience and easier time planning for grandparents when their grandchildren come over.  </p>

                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>Senior users can copy link and share to their family members in family page, the user’s family members with the link can access this webpage we designed which is called my family cloud, then they can add and edit content and information. This webpage is offered to help senior users have a better user experience throughout our app. This feature is supposed to prevent senior users to worry too much about dealing with the information of their grandchildren, instead, let their younger family members do these works. </p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>We created a user-friendly, accessible, and responsive company website. The project involved collaboration using GitKraken, distributing the work, and merging it later. We followed a design process that prioritized effective information architecture, relevant content, and website accessibility and usability. We also focused on code validity, readability, and cleanliness of folder structure. Overall, the project provided us with valuable experience in collaborating effectively as a team, building a website, and prioritizing user experience.</p>
