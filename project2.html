                <p>To collaborate effectively on this project, we used GitKraken, which allowed us to distribute the work and merge it later. We created branches for each feature, which allowed us to work on different aspects of the project simultaneously without interfering with each other's progress.</p>
                <p>We also set up a weekly check-in to discuss our progress and ensure that we were on track to meet our deadlines.</p>
