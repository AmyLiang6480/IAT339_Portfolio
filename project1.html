                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>The primary objective of our app is to help grandparents prepare meals and plan activities that their grandchildren would enjoy. This app was created to address the gap in the childcare services of grandparents who may not have formal training in childcare.</p>

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>Before designing the app, we conducted extensive research to understand the needs and preferences of grandparents and their grandchildren. Our research revealed that 38% of grandparents take care of their grandkids. </p>
                <p>Additionally, many grandparents expect to establish seamless and joyful conversation with their grandkids. Therefore, we created an app that recommends popular food and activities based on the child's age.</p>

                <h2>Design Process</h2>
                <p>Our team started the design process by creating sketches and user flows in Figma and FigJam. We wanted to ensure that the app was easy to use and navigate. </p>
                <p>We then conducted research on specific food and activity items to offer a range of options for grandparents to choose from. </p>
                <p>Based on our research, we explored different design pathways presented by interaction storyboards.</p>

                <h2>Interactive Prototype</h2>
                <p>After finalizing the design, we created an interactive prototype by using Protopie. The prototype helped us visualize how the app would function in real life. We tested the prototype internally to ensure that it was user-friendly and intuitive.</p>

                <h2>User Testing</h2>
                <p>We conducted user testing studies to gather feedback from grandparents and their children. We identified problems and sources of confusion using the methods listed above, as well as notes and observations from the studies. </p>

                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The major issue became to one of our key feature: a family page where user could save their grandchildren’s information, so when they select specific grandchild, the app can filter content for them based on their age, dietary preferences and restrictions. </p>
                <p>But this feature confused most users in our user testing. </p>
                <p>It conflicts our ultimate goal of offering a light user experience and easier time planning for grandparents when their grandchildren come over.  </p>

                <p>Senior users can copy link and share to their family members in family page, the user’s family members with the link can access this webpage we designed which is called my family cloud, then they can add and edit content and information. </p>
                <p>This webpage is offered to help senior users have a better user experience throughout our app. This feature is supposed to prevent senior users to worry too much about dealing with the information of their grandchildren, instead, let their younger family members do these works. </p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>We created a user-friendly and intuitive app for grandparents to prepare meals and plan activities for their grandkids. </p>
                <p>The project involved extensive research, design exploration, and user testing, and we learned the importance of gathering feedback and iterating on our designs to create the best possible user experience. </p>
                <p>This project provided us with valuable experience in designing digital interfaces that meet the needs of real-world users.</p>
