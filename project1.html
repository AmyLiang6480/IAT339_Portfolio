                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>The primary objective of our app is to help grandparents prepare meals and plan activities that their grandchildren would enjoy. This app was created to address the gap in the childcare services provided by grandparents who may not have formal training in childcare.</p>

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>Before designing the app, we conducted extensive research to understand the needs and preferences of grandparents and their grandchildren. Our research revealed that 38% of grandparents take care of their grandkids. Additionally, many grandparents are not trained to provide childcare services, and they may have different ideas of what constitutes a fun activity or day. Therefore, we created an app that recommends popular food and activities based on the child's age.</p>

                <h2>Design Process</h2>
                <p>Our team started the design process by creating sketches and user flows in Figma and FigJam. We wanted to ensure that the app was easy to use and navigate. We then conducted research on specific food and activity items to offer a range of options for grandparents to choose from. Based on our research, we explored different design pathways presented by interaction storyboards.</p>

                <h2>Interactive Prototype</h2>
                <p>After finalizing the design, we created an interactive prototype by using Protopie. The prototype helped us visualize how the app would function in real life. We tested the prototype internally to ensure that it was user-friendly and intuitive.</p>

                <h2>User Testing</h2>
                <p>We conducted user testing studies to gather feedback from grandparents and their children. We identified problems and sources of confusion using the methods listed above, as well as notes and observations from the studies. The feedback helped us identify areas for improvement and refine the app's design. </p>

                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>Looked for common issues and points of confusion throughout studies done by users. The major issue became to one of our key feature: a family page where user could save their grandchildren’s information, so when they select specific grandchild, the app can filter content for them based on their age, dietary preferences and restrictions. But this feature confused most users in our user testing: Four participants went to the home page to find the information about what a grandchild likes, a task that was supposed to be completed on the Family page. It conflicts our ultimate goal of offering a light user experience and easier time planning for grandparents when their grandchildren come over.  </p>

                <h2>Solution: For Grand — My Family Cloud (open in browser)</h2>
                <p>Senior users can copy link and share to their family members in family page, the user’s family members with the link can access this webpage we designed which is called my family cloud, then they can add and edit content and information. This webpage is offered to help senior users have a better user experience throughout our app. This feature is supposed to prevent senior users to worry too much about dealing with the information of their grandchildren, instead, let their younger family members do these works. </p>

                <h2>Final Prototype</h2>
                <p>After several iterations, we finalized the app's design and created the final prototype. The final prototype was user-tested once again to ensure that it met the needs of our target audience.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>We created a user-friendly and intuitive app for grandparents to prepare meals and plan activities for their grandkids. The project involved extensive research, design exploration, and user testing, and we learned the importance of gathering feedback and iterating on our designs to create the best possible user experience. Overall, the project provided us with valuable experience in designing digital interfaces that meet the needs of real-world users.</p>
